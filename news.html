								<h3>NMOFs for Real-Time Intracellular pH Sensing</h3>
								<p>August 22, 2014</p>
							</header>
							<img src="imgs/news/phSensing.png" class="image news">
							<p class="align-justify">
								Real-time measurement of
					intracellular pH in live cells is of great importance for understanding
					physiological/pathological processes and developing intra-cellular drug
					delivery systems. As reported in in Journal of American Chemical
					Society (2014, <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja507333c">DOI:
					10.1021/ja507333c</a>), the Lin group has demonstrated the first
					use of nanoscale metal‚àíorganic frameworks (NMOFs) for intracellular pH
					sensing in live cells. UiO NMOFs conjugated to flourescein
					isothiocyanate (F-UiO) not only showed excellent ratiometric pH-sensing
					properties but also remained structurally intact inside endosomes,
					allowing for live cell imaging studies. F-UiO allowed the real time
					observation of endo- and exocytosis of F-UiO and endosome
					acidification. Fluorescently labeled NMOFs thus represent a new class
					of nanosensors for intracellular pH sensing and studying NMOF-cell
					interactions. This work has been featured in JACS Spotlight for the
					probe's ability to retain the benefits of fluorescent pH sensors
					without dye leaching and clumping.</p><br>

								<h3>NCPs for Cancer Therapy</h3>
							</header>
							<img src="imgs/news/NatComArt.jpg" class="image news">
							<p class="align-justify">
								The Lin group recently designed self-assembled
					nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) for highly effective cancer
					therapy. As reported in Nature Communications (<a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140625/ncomms5182/full/ncomms5182.html">2014,
					DOI: 10.1038</a>), the NCPs carry 48¬±3 wt% cisplatin prodrug (1)
					and 45¬±5 wt% oxaliplatin prodrug (2) with selective and substantial
					accumulation of chemotherapeutics in solid tumours via the passive
					targeting pathways. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in mice showed
					minimal uptake of pegylated NCPs by the mononuclear phagocyte system
					and excellent blood circulation half-lives of 16.4¬±2.9 h and 12.0¬±3.9 h
					for pegylated 1 and 2, respectively. In several tumor xenograft models
					evaluated, pegylated NCPs showed superior potency and efficacy compared
					to free drugs. NCPs have thus been demonstrated as a highly effective
					drug delivery platform for cancer therapy by virtue of tunable
					compositions, sizes, and shapes; high drug loadings; ease of surface
					modification; and intrinsic biodegradability. </p><br>

								The Lin group
					recently designed and developed highly stable and recyclable
					single-site solid catalysts via post-synthetic metalation of the
					2,2'-bipyridyl-derived metal-organic framework (MOF) of the UiO
					structure (bpy-UiO) with iridium or palladium precursors. As reported
					in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja5018267">2014,
					136 (18), pp 6566‚Äì6569</a>), the Ir-functionalized MOF
					(bpy-UiO-Ir) is a highly active catalyst for both borylation of
					aromatic C-H bonds using B2(pin)2 (pin = pinacolate) and
					ortho-silylation of benzylic¬¨silyl ethers; the ortho-silylation
					activity of the bpy-UiO-Ir is at least three orders of magnitude higher
					than that of the homogeneous control. The Pd-functionalized MOF
					(bpy-UiO-Pd) catalyzes the dehydrogenation of substituted
					cyclohexenones to afford phenol derivatives with oxygen as the oxidant.
					Most impressively, the bpy-UiO-Ir was recycled and reused 20 times for
					the borylation reaction without loss of catalytic activity or MOF
					crystallinity. This work highlights the opportunity in designing highly
					stable and active catalysts based on MOFs containing nitrogen donor
					ligands for important organic transformations.</p>

								<h3>MOF for Highly Efficient X-ray Scintillation</h3>

							<img src="imgs/news/XrayInducedFluo.jpg" class="image news">

								As published in the Journal of the

					136 (17), pp 6171‚Äì6174</a>), the Lin Group reported two
					metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) capable of efficiently converting X-ray
					radiation to visible-light luminescence. The MOFs are constructed from
					M6(¬µ3-O)4(¬µ3-OH)4(carboxylate)12 (M = Hf or Zr) secondary building
					units (SBUs) and anthracene-based dicarboxylate bridging ligands. The
					high atomic number Zr and Hf in the SBUs serve as effective X-ray
					antenna by absorbing X-ray photons and converting them to fast
					electrons through the photoelectric effect. The generated electrons
					then excite multiple anthracene-based emitters in the MOF through
					inelastic scattering, leading to efficient generation of detectable
					photons in the visible spectrum. The MOF materials thus serve as
					efficient X-ray scintillators via synergistic X-ray absorption by the
					metal-cluster SBUs and optical emission by the bridging ligands. This
					work was performed in collaboration with the research group of Lei Xing
					at the Stanford University School of Medicine.</p><br>

								the Lin group developed a robust and porous Zr metal-organic framework
								(MOF) based on a BINAP-derived dicarboxylate linker, BINAP-MOF.
								Post-synthetic metalation with Ru and Rh complexes afforded highly
								enantioselective catalysts for important organic transformations.
								Notably, the Rh-functionalized MOF is not only highly enantioselective
								(up to &gt;99% e.e.) but also 3 times as active as the homogeneous
								control. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS),
								performed in collaboration with the Lockard group of Rutgers
								University, revealed that the Ru-functionalized MOF contains Ru-BINAP
								precatalysts with the same coordination environment as the homogeneous
								Ru complex. The post-synthetically metalated BINAP-MOFs provide a
								versatile family of single-site solid catalysts for catalyzing a broad
								scope of asymmetric organic transformations, including the addition of
								aryl and alkyl groups to Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones as well as the

					Computing, DFT calculations were performed to further investigate the
					catalytic system. Experimental and computational studies suggest that
					the ligand participates in electron transfer processes to facilitate
					the oxidation of the Cu center to lead to an active WOC with low

								Researchers

					MOF-1, from a chiral tetracarboxylate bridging ligand derived from
					1,1‚Ä≤-bi-2-naphthol, BINOL, and a cadmium carboxylate infinite-chain
					secondary building unit. The fluorescence of MOF-1&nbsp;can be
					effectively quenched by amino alcohols via H-bonding with the
					binaphthol moieties decorating the MOF, leading to a remarkable chiral
					sensor for amino alcohols with greatly enhanced sensitivity and
					enantioselectivity over BINOL-based homogeneous systems. The higher
					detection sensitivity of MOF-1&nbsp;is due to a preconcentration
					effect by which the analytes are absorbed and concentrated inside the
					MOF channels, whereas the higher enantioselectivity of
					MOF-1&nbsp;is believed to result from enhanced chiral
					discrimination owing to the cavity confinement effect and the
					conformational rigidity of the BINOL groups in the framework.
					MOF-1&nbsp;was quenched by four chiral amino alcohols with
